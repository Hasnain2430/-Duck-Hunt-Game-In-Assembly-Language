# -Duck-Hunt-Game-In-Assembly-Language
A classic arcade shooter in assembly: players shoot flying ducks with limited bullets. Each three missed ducks costs a life; the game ends when lives run out. Mode 1 has three rounds of single ducks; Mode 2 has multiple, faster ducks. A scoreboard tracks current and high scores, and a lives bar shows remaining lives.
